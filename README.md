  <h3>Going open source!</h3>
  <p>Knowledge is not something we should ever gate keep, usually I like keeping my code private, avoiding anyone stealing anything or copying anything. But on 1/16/2025, I've made the choice that my knowledge is better shared, who cares if you use my code? Go learn!</p>
  <p>There are two things I ask, If you intend to use the utils, in any way, give credit, please! I'll leave a folder in every release with guidelines for that. And if you just intend to rip the code. Please use it to learn, not to copy and paste, but get an idea of how to do something, and try it yourself. Knowledge is power people!</p>
  <p>As extension, found a bug? create an issue, or make a branch, fix it before I can, and merge request!</p>
